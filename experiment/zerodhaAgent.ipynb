      "I don't need any additional inputs because the function doesn't require parameters like city names—it’s hardcoded for Tokyo. So, I should call getWeather() without any arguments.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I execute this function, it will return a string with the current weather data. This could include details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and maybe even some descriptive terms about the weather condition such as sunny, cloudy, or rainy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I receive the response from getWeather(), that will be the final answer to the user's query because there's no need for further processing. The function is reliable and provides all the necessary information directly.\n",
